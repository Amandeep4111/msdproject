Flower Garden is a full-stack web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It allows users to add, view, and manage flowers or plants in a digital garden. Users can register, log in securely, and maintain their own plant dashboard while also viewing all flowers on the public home page.
